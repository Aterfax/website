# Contributing

Pull requests are very welcome, but please bear in mind the following:

- Are you addressing an existing issue? 
  - Fork the repository to your account and make a pull request, **even if you're in the SLUGSoc organisation**.
  - Please assign yourself or ask to be assigned, and do this promptly.
  - Work in keeping with the existing standards that have been set. Ensure that tests pass and that RuboCop does not report offenses.
- Are you raising an issue?
  - Issues can also be raised as PRs if you know how to fix the issue. Follow the guidelines above in that instance.
  - Word the title and content of your issue effectively. Good examples include "Div overflow on events show page" and "Events are not created with end time". These clearly outline the issue and the acceptance criteria for the issue to be closed.
  - Give acceptance criteria. These should describe a state in which the project should be for the issue to no longer affect it. Examples include "Events have the correct end time when seeded from the Facebook API" and "Events are no longer visible once their end time has passed".
  - Ensure all PRs and issues raised have a direct goal for the improvement of the project or its maintainability.

## Other rules

Stay on topic. As a society, we do like to joke around, but nothing on the repo should serve this purpose. 

DBAD. Don't use offensive, vulgar or insensitive language, and don't exclude developers, society members or others in general.

Repeat offenders will not be permitted to contribute to the repository and, if they are involved with the society directly, this may come at further consequence from the committee.
